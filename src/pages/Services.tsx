        "Advanced Cellular Rejuvenation Therapy. Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD) is a vital coenzyme found in every cell of the body. It plays a key role in cellular energy production and is essential for many biological processes that keep our cells healthy. As we age, NAD+ levels naturally decline, with studies showing up to a 50% reduction in NAD by middle age and further depletion in older age. This decline can lead to reduced energy production, less efficient DNA repair, higher oxidative stress, and weaker cellular resilience, leading to weakened immunity and inflammation. Maintaining NAD Levels will ensure age-related diseases and symptoms like fatigue, slower healing, and weakened immunity can be significantly enhanced and reduce risk of Metabolic Disorders. NAD supports brain function by fueling neurons and helping waste removal. As NAD levels fall, brain cells may suffer, impairing memory, focus, and mood. Bottom Line: Oxidative damage, when unmanaged, accelerates aging and leads to diseases like cardiovascular issues, cataracts, and more. NAD is essential to keep oxidative stress under control.",
